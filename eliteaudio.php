                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>Design and build a responsive website to promote a new product.</p>

                <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                <p>I began the logo design process by quickly sketching out some mark concepts. A lot of my ideas referenced audio visualization and waveforms, but many of them were too basic to be used as a unique identifier. I continued mixing different elements together, and I came up with the idea of showing a visualizer inside of a stylized waveform. I experimented with various size relationships until I found a visually interesting solution.</p>

              <p>The logo type is set in Futura, which helps to convey a sense of sophisticated style. When developing the color palette, I chose an electric green and paired it with a complimentary dark purple. The color of "Audio" is set in the bright green or dark green depending on the background color.</p>

              <h2>Product Page Design</h2>
              <p>When designing the product page, my goal was to break away from some of my normal layout habits. I used various grid compositions to create visual interest throughout the design. I intentionally broke outside the grid in a couple spots and went full-bleed with the photo array. Type is set in various weights of Roboto.</p>
