                <h2>My Journey to Design</h2>
                <p>Around the age of twelve, my Uncle introduced me to a program called Photoshop. I was instantly hooked, and I began creating exceptionally horrible art. I used to spend hours crafting my own websites with table-based layouts and way too many effects. Fast-forward to High School, I was given the oppurtunity to take a Graphic Design class. I learned how to use Illustrator and was amazed by the posibilites of vector graphics.</p>
                
                <p>I initially began College as a Graphic Design major, but I was a bit disappointed by the scarsity of Web Design in the curriculum. I wanted to learn more about how to code, and I transferred to the Communications department. I taught myself basic php through a independent study class and built my own simple cms.</p>
                
                <p>Upon graduating from College, I started a freelance Web Design & Development company and focused primarily on custom WordPress theming. I enjoyed the work, but I missed having people to bounce ideas off of and learn from. In 2014, I took a position as a Front-end Developer at a small Marketing Communications firm. It was great experience and I got to work on bigger projects, but I missed designing.</p>
                
                <p>I began looking into UI/UX classes, and eventually I came across <a href="http://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>. I started their UI/UX program at the beginning of June, and I'll be finishing up in August. I'm currently job-hunting and looking forward to new challenges!</p>
