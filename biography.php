                <h2>My Journey to Design</h2>
                <p><img src="img/michael-roach-small.jpg" alt="Michael Roach" class="float-left hide-for-large-up bio-photo small-circle"> Around the age of twelve, my Uncle introduced me to a program called Photoshop. I was instantly hooked, and I began creating exceptionally horrible art. I used to spend hours crafting my own websites with table-based layouts and way too many effects. Fast-forward to High School, I was given the oppurtunity to take a Graphic Design class. I learned how to use Illustrator and was amazed by the posibilites of vector graphics.</p>
                
                <p>I initially began College as a Graphic Design major, but I was a bit disappointed by the scarsity of Web Design in the curriculum. I wanted to learn more about how to code, and I transferred to the Communications department. I taught myself basic php through a independent study class and built my own simple cms.</p>
                
                <p>Upon graduating from College, I started a freelance Web Design & Development company and focused primarily on custom WordPress theming. I enjoyed the work, but I missed having people to bounce ideas off of and learn from. In 2014, I took a position as a Front-end Developer at <a href="http://www.studio105.com" target="_blank">Studio 105</a>, a small Marketing Communications firm. It was great experience and I got to work on bigger projects, but I missed designing.</p>
                
                <p>I began looking into UI/UX classes, and I completed a certificate program through <a href="http://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>. In August of 2015, I took a full-time position at <a href="http://www.power-marketing.com" target="_blank">Power Marketing</a> in Hagerstown, MD.</p>
